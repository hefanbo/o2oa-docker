## Get

To download the latest release file:

Then unzip the file located in the `o2oa/install_files` directory.

If you would like to compile O2OA from the source, you can copy the directory `<build_dir>/target/o2server` to `o2oa/install_files`.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose build

To run containers:
[source,bash]

$ docker-compose up -d

Two containers will be started. One is for Postgres database, and the other is for O2OA.

A directory named `volumes` will be created as the datastore if it does not exist.
